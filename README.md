# Discord Emoji Pack Download

Feeling lost because Packs feature deprecated this soon? Don't worry, as long as you can access your `/inventory`, you are fine!

Just drop the output of `/inventory` payload into a `data.json` placed beside this program, and it'll do the magic for you to download.

Later afterwards [Emoji Repacker](https://github.com/ReiFan49/discord-emoji-repacker) Bot will do the work.
